crossbuild.txt, October 2019


On a Debian Buster(-based) x86_64 system it is possible to set up cross build toolchains for all platforms supported by Pure Data. Most 
tools are available as Debian packages. 

Since g++ compilers depend on gcc which in turn depend on libc, installing g++ should result in a complete toolchain for a given platform.

- g++-i386-linux-gnu (for Linux 32 bit builds)
- g++-arm-linux-gnueabihf (for ARM 32 bit builds)
- g++-aarch64-linux-gnu (for ARM 64 bit builds)
- mingw-w64 (gcc & g++ for Windows 32 and 64 bit builds)


-------------------------------------------------


Cross tools for target OSX are not available as Debian packages. Instead use this project:

    github.com/tpoechtrager/osxcross

It has excellent documentation, but not all described steps are needed on Debian(-based) systems. Summary of setup:

1 - install packages: clang cmake git patch python libssl-dev
lzma-dev libxml2-dev

2 - copy osxcross project tree on your Linux system

3 - on Linux or OSX, use osxcross to make OSX SDK tarball*

4 - copy SDK tarball into dir "tarballs" of osxcross on your Linux system

5 - in osxcross root dir on Linux, run ./build.sh to build the cross tools

6 - if successful, dir target/bin in osxcross holds the cross build tools

7 - add this path to $PATH when using the tools


* osxcross defines many ways to build an SDK tarball. If you have access to OSX with dev tools installed, copy osxcross to that machine and call script:

    ./tools/gen_sdk_package.sh.
  
It will pack any SDK found. If you copy more than one SDK to dir "tarballs" on Linux, select a version when building:

    $ SDK_VERSION=<version> ./build.sh
 
-------------------------------------------------


Notes:
 
The SDK version to be used for the ARM64 platform no longer supports i386. Therefore an older version is
also installed. As of 2023-03 the versions 20.2 and 12 are used.

If you change the location of the build SDK, you also have to rebuild it. There are hard-coded paths in
the created binary files. If you get compile errors about a random library being not found, a rebuild might fix the problem.
